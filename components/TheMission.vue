        this project is supposed to offer an easy way to discover new music and
        have your music heard by others. algorithms on many music platforms will
        almost never recommend smaller artists so they're hard to find. i want
        kittycat.homes radio to be an alternative to this. it should be as easy
        as possible to find new music.
        <br />
        <br />
        i also want this radio station to provide a pleasant listening experience.
