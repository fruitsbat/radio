        this station doesn't make any money and i'm not planning on running ads
        or anything like that anytime soon (ads suck! just let everyone listen to
        music!), so sadly i can't offer any royalties. if this does change
        through some unlikely turn of events and it goes past being just self
        sustaining i'll be sure to let everyone know.
        <br />

        you <strong>will</strong> get the satisfaction of having contributed to
        a community project and maybe some new ears on your music.

        i'm excited to hear from everyone! :)
